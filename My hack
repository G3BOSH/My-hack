How this script works:
 * Get LocalPlayer: It first gets the LocalPlayer, which is the player running this specific script. This script should be placed in StarterPlayerScripts so it runs on the client.
 * Check for Player: It checks if the LocalPlayer exists.
 * setWalkSpeed Function: This function takes a speed value as input and sets the WalkSpeed property of the player's Humanoid. It also includes a check to ensure the Character and Humanoid exist before attempting to modify the speed.
 * Create UI:
   * A ScreenGui is created to hold the user interface elements. ResetOnSpawn is set to false so the UI persists even when the player respawns.
   * A Frame is created to act as a container for the slider and label. Its size and position are set.
   * A TextLabel is created for the title "Walk Speed".
   * A Slider is created with Min set to 1 and Max set to 100. Its initial Value is set to the player's current WalkSpeed (or 16 if the character hasn't loaded yet).
   * Another TextLabel (speedValueLabel) is created to display the current numerical walk speed.
 * Connect Slider Event:
   * The GetPropertyChangedSignal("Value") of the Slider is connected to a function. This function is called whenever the slider's value changes.
   * Inside the function:
     * The new slider value is rounded down using math.floor().
     * The setWalkSpeed function is called to update the player's walk speed.
     * The Text of the speedValueLabel is updated to display the new speed value.
 * Initial Speed Set: After creating the UI, the script attempts to set the initial walk speed based on the slider's default value, in case the character has already loaded.
 * CharacterAdded Event: This event is fired whenever the player's character is added (initially or after respawning). The script connects a function to this event to ensure that the walk speed is updated to the slider's current value whenever the character spawns. This handles cases where the player might respawn with the default walk speed.
 * Error Handling: The script includes a warn() message if the LocalPlayer is not found. The setWalkSpeed function also includes a warn() if the Character or Humanoid are not found yet.
How to use this script in Roblox Studio:
 * Open your game in Roblox Studio.
 * Go to the Explorer window.
 * Navigate to StarterPlayer -> StarterPlayerScripts.
 * Right-click on StarterPlayerScripts and select "Insert Object" -> "LocalScript".
 * Copy and paste the entire code into the newly created LocalScript.
 * Run your game. You should now see a UI element (a frame with a slider and a label) on your screen. Dragging the slider will change your character's walk speed in real-time.
Customization:
 * UI Position and Size: You can adjust the Size and Position properties of the mainFrame in the script to change where the UI appears on the screen.
 * Colors and Fonts: You can customize the BackgroundColor3, TextColor3, and Font properties of the UI elements to match your game's style.
 * Default Speed: The initial value of the slider is set to the player's current WalkSpeed or 16. You can change this default value in the slider.Value line.
 * Slider Range: While the script sets the range to 1-100, you can modify the slider.Min and slider.Max properties if you need a different range. However, be aware that extremely high walk speeds might cause unexpected behavior in your game.
